> Rather than taking a screenshot showing the output of an accessibility tool, in many cases you
> can directly copy the text. For instance when using the Inspect tool from the Windows SDK:
> 1. In the tree-view focus the element which you are interested in.
> 1. Press F6 to move focus to the properties pane on the right.
> 1. Select all, then copy and paste this into the issue.
>
> This will contain all of the properties for the selected element, as well as the names/roles of
> it's ancestors and children.
